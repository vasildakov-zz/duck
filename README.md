## Composition over inheritance

"Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance from a base or parent class." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)
